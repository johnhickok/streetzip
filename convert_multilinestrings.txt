Use qgis and select a small, clean selection of roads features with no special non-UTF8 characters.

Export your selection to a small shapefile.

Remove all but the name field.

Use shp2pgsql-gui.exe, found in
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.5\bin\postgisgui

and upload your small shapefile into your database.

Open PGADMIN, navigate to your database and open the SQL window.

By default, the PG shapeloader converted your shapefile to a table with your geom field being of type MULTILINESTRING.

As an example, type in the following:

select gid, name, st_astext(geom) from roads;

To make sure you don't have any multilinestring, enter the following:

SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN ST_NumGeometries(geom) > 1 THEN 1 END) AS multi_geom,
COUNT(geom) AS total_geom
FROM roads;

To convert the geom field to LINESTRING from MULTILINESTRING, enter
(see http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/49950/converting-mulitlinestring-to-linestring-in-postgresql-with-postgis)

ALTER TABLE roads
ALTER COLUMN geom TYPE geometry(linestring,4326) USING ST_GeometryN(geom, 1);
